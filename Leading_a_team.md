# 1. Managing vs Leading

## 1.1 Knowing when you're managing and when you're leading
Throughout your day, you're probably going back and forth between managing and leading. In today's modern organizations, leadership and management are closely intertwined because almost all people who manage others and projects or functions also have to provide leadership to their people in the organization. Let's explore the important distinctions between them.  

The `primary goal of leadership is to produce change and growth`. The work of a leader is to envision a better tomorrow and design the change that will get the organization from here to there.  

The `primary goal of management is to produce order and consistency`. The work of a manager is to create a stable work environment that's clear and consistent so that employees can be as productive as possible. There are some natural tensions between management and leadership. Think about your day-to-day work over the past two weeks and identify when you're managing and when you're leading.  

Here are some key things to look for.  

1. The first distinction is about approach. Managing is tactical and hands-on, while leading is strategic and visionary. This is because the time frame is different. 
2. Managing occurs in the here and now. You're looking at the short-term and mid-range goals that ensure success of the organization today. Contrast that with leading, where the focus in on the future and setting strategy and change to create the organization of tomorrow. 
3. Another difference is that the focus shifts. For management, the focus is narrow and internal whereas the leader's view is broad and external, including other functions, industry, market, and national and global affairs.  
**As an example**, let's look at Adriana, who works for The Landen Hotel Company. Landen hotels can be found in 20 countries and 400 cities. Adriana is the Events Manager at a large property in Quito, the capital of Ecuador. She's one of 12 department directors, each of whom report to the hotel manager and have direct reports of their own. Adriana manages a team of four people, and they interface with several departments from facilities to the kitchen. Adriana is managing when she runs department meetings discussing upcoming events. She's leading when she identifies that many companies now have remote employees, and she proposes new models for hosting conferences that'll allow for remote access. 
4. Managing relies on current resources and structures, while leading designs new ones for the future. 
Adriana is using her managing skills when she conducts a performance review for an employee using the current system. She's leading, when after learning more about what drives employee engagement, she proposes that the company's performance management system change from target-based to competency-based measures. 
5. For managing the task goals are directing the daily work of employees to achieve currently identified goals, whereas leading requires planning for the future, setting a long-term vision and strategy to bring about the change. 
Adriana is managing when she implements a new online event management system and provides training on how to use it. She's leading when she creates an innovative internship program with a local culinary school to cultivate the best students as future employees and caterers. 
6. The people skills differ as well. Both managing and leading rely on emotional intelligence, but managing is more tactical, like conducting one-on-one meetings, delegating tasks, and coaching employees to improve performance. Leading is about building the culture to maximize engagement, inspiring various stakeholders with a compelling vision, fostering collaboration, and cultivating the next generation of leaders. All of this is in service to achieving the future potential of the organization by maximizing the most important asset, its talented people. 
Adriana is managing when she delegates various events to her team, rotating roles to build their skills. She's leading when she identifies some high potential employees and creates a cross functional team to assess industry trends and innovate new models. 

## 1.2 Exploring manager roles
As a manager, you'll play a few different roles. 
1. **Producer**. You must produce the desired results and achieve the organization's goals through projects and tasks. 
2. **Administrator**. You must administer systems, policies, and procedures so that the organization runs efficiently. 
3. **Innovator**. In order to enact change that serves the organization's future, you'll need to be creative and innovate new ideas or solutions. 
4. **Mediator**. Not only will you need to help our employees work through conflict, you'll also mediate any tensions between the employees' needs and the organization's. 
5. **Culture builder**. You must build a work environment and culture that values its members and supports the organization's goals. 
Each role requires different skill sets and you may be better at some than others. You want to play to your strengths and develop the areas in which you still need to grow. Also, think about how you can utilize the strengths of your people to balance you. It also happens that these roles can actually be in conflict with each other. For example, administering a policy might actually limit innovation, or enacting change might threaten the current culture.  

Part of being a manager is knowing how to balance these roles, and also when to prioritize one over another. This can be confusing, because there's actually two primary perspectives to consider.  
One is the employees' perspective, which focuses on the experience of the people under the manager. This is the one we're all most familiar with, because we've all been under a manager at some point in our careers.  
The other is the organization's perspective, which focuses on the effective completion of work that drives the organization's success. Every manager must find a way to live at the intersection of these two different and sometimes competing perspectives. Let's take a deeper look.  

I'm going to start with the **organization's perspective**, because it really does come first. Everyone is employed to help the organization accomplish its goals. It's also true that the organization's perspective is what has driven management style since the 1800s. The organization's perspective includes several key questions like: 
 - Are the assigned projects and tasks completed? 
 - Does the work get completed on time and within the allotted budget? 
 - Is the level of work quality sufficient to accomplish the goals? 
 - Is the organization protected from lawsuits by compliance with state and federal laws and regulations? 
 - Does any innovation occur that enhances the organization's success? 
 - Does the manager hire and develop employees who make positive contributions to the organization over time? 

From this list it becomes obvious that from the **organization's perspective**, key management skills include: 
 - project management, 
 - time management, 
 - resource management, 
 - communication, 
 - decision making, 
 - people skills, 
 - performance management. 

Now let's switch to the **employees' perspective.** The people who report to a manager have several key questions like: 
 - Are my tasks and responsibilities made clear? 
 - Am I given the training, guidance, and resources to complete the tasks? 
 - Are my skill sets effectively used, and am I given opportunities to grow? 
 - Am I treated fairly and with respect? 
 - Can I see that my contributions make a difference, and are they measured accurately? 
 - Is my worth accurately assessed and valued? 
 - Is there a clear career path for me to advance and grow? 

From the **employees' perspective**, key management skills include 
 - communication, 
 - people skills, 
 - performance management, 
 - training, 
 - coaching, 
 - fairness or ethics. 

There is overlap. The employee interaction is in service of the organization's goals, and the organization provides meaningful work and fair compensation to the employee. To be a successful manager, you’ll need to find a way to artfully navigate the inherent tensions and opportunities that live between the needs of your employees and the goals of your organization. 

## 1.3 Understanding management styles
Management styles are the patterns of behavior people use when they hold management positions. These patterns of behavior include how they communicate, make decisions, supervise, and motivate.  
There's a range of management styles and all are a blend of three key behaviors. Task direction, decision making, and relationship building.  

 - **Task direction is when the manager tells the employee what to do, as well as when, where, and how.** This may involve teaching and training as well as directives and instructions.  
 - **Decision making is the extent to which the manager involves employees in the decision making process.** This exists on a continuum. At one end, employees have no involvement at all, and at the other end the manager delegates decision making completely to the employees.  
 - **Relationship building is how the manager forms a relationship with each employee as well as creates the work environment or culture for the team as a whole.** It includes coaching, motivating and engaging employees, open communication, and respect. 

Let me walk through the most common management styles. 

 - **"The Director."** This manager wants to be in charge so controls all aspect of decision making. They provide a lot of task direction and are often seen as micro-managers. Directors don't engage much in relationship building although they can be cordial. A hallmark phrase is, "Do what I say." This autocratic style is appropriate when employees have very low levels of skill or initiative, or when the organization is in a crisis and needs immediate change. However, The Director ultimately does harm to the organization, because employees are not motivated and don't get opportunities to develop. 
 - **"The Consultant."** This manager still maintains control of decision making, but knows that relationship building is important so consults with employees to gain their input. Employees can feel more engaged with this style, if the consulting is genuine. Consultants still provide task direction, but allow low levels of autonomy. The phrase for this style is, "I value your input." This style works well with employees who are growing in their skills or confidence, but not yet to the level where they can handle complex tasks on their own. 
 - **"The Consensus Builder,"** who manages democratically. This manager genuinely seeks input and feedback from all sides. They focus on what's best for the group, so often make decisions based on majority preference or consensus. The phrase here is, "What do you think?" The downside of this style is that they may take too much time seeking input, or ignoring the best decision, in favor of the choice that has the most support. 
 - **"The Coach."** This manager focuses on creating a highly productive and motivated staff. They provide both training as well as encouragement to grow. They often create a fun and positive work environment with lots of team building and social activities. The hallmark phrase is, "How can I support you?" This style is great for mid to high performers. But coaches can stumble if they have poor performers or difficult employees who don't respond to their encouragement. 
 - **"The Visionary."** This manager has an exciting vision and they're good at inspiring or persuading others to get onboard. Often, they're great at strategic thinking but not so good with tactical skills. This manager is exemplified by the phrase, "Follow me!" To thrive under this style, employees need to be independent because they have to figure out the day-to-day work for themselves. 
 - **"The Delegator."** This manager uses a very hands off or Laissez-faire approach to management. They turn over almost complete control to their team, stepping in only when necessary. This style only works well with high performing employees. The phrase here is, "You've got this." Delegators have to remember that while they may be able to hand over task performance and decision making, they must continue to build relationships. 
 - **"The Narcissist,"** and it's actually the most harmful style, with very few redeeming qualities. The narcissist maintains control by providing a lot of task direction and no decision making. They engage in relationship building but only to garner favors or support, abruptly dropping people when it no longer suits their needs. This person is very self-centered, but they can still be likable, often even charming. But they rule with an iron fist, using punishments from firing to petty retaliations to keep people in line. People under them are in fear so they cannot speak up or seek help. Often once this person leaves or is let go, a whole series of shocking information comes to the surface. To know if you have this most toxic kind of boss, look for high turn over, or a boss that takes all the credit for their team's successes, and blames their team for any failures.  

As you review these styles, think about which styles you've experienced as an employee. What impact did the styles have on your productivity, motivation, and loyalty to the organization? Also, consider which style is most like you. We all tend to have a favorite or natural style that we use the most. 

## 1.4 Choosing the right style
**So which style should you choose?**  
Well, it all depends on your situation. With the exception of the Narcissist, all of the styles can be useful in certain context. While no one individual style is good or bad, a management style can be a good or poor fit for the situation, which determines its effectiveness.  
Let's start with your natural style of management. Which of the styles is most like you? If you're not sure, ask friends and colleagues for their feedback.  
It's important to know which style you default to, because that's what you're likely to do under stress. Ultimately, your natural style may be the fit for some of your employees, and they will thrive under you, but if you want your entire team to thrive, you must be willing to become versed in all of the styles. It's the manager's responsibility to be the chameleon and change your style to suit the situation. By picking the best style for the situation, you'll maximize the productivity and engagement of your people. To determine which style to use, first assess the skills and attitudes of each of your employees. Consider their job description and identify the skills or competencies they need to be successful. Rate their current competence in those skills.  
Also look at their attitudes. Are they enthusiastic and motivated? Cautious or nervous, or even disengaged and bored? Look at how they get along as a group. Are they cohesive and friendly? Or is there a lot of tension or conflict? Now, you apply combinations of task direction, relationship-building and decision-making to bring out their best.  
With employees who are new or unskilled, use high amounts of task direction and relationship-building. This will help them learn what they need to do the job, as well start building a positive connection between you. You'd want to use the director and consultant styles. Over time, as you see evidence that your employees are becoming more skilled and confident, you'll throttle back on task direction as needed and maintain relationship-building. Also now add some decision-making to push their growth and development. Now you don't just hand over a big decision to them, but first start involving them in discussions about decision-making. Begin by seeking their input and sharing what you're doing and why. As they get the hang of it, then you can let them make some low-risk decisions. This is when you might want to use the consensus builder and coach styles. Continue to build relationships as you push their skill development with more and more opportunities for decision-making. Once your employees are highly skilled, you can delegate a lot of things to them. At this point, you're providing very little task-direction and even then, it's rare. You're also giving them a lot of autonomy with decision-making, increasing the complexity of projects to keep them challenged and engaged. You can also dial down the relationship-building, as you should have a strong foundation of trust and respect to stand on. However, be careful that you don't stop relationship-building altogether. Even your top performers still need encouragement and acknowledgement. You'll find that the visionary and delegator styles work well for you here. Especially because as your team grows, you can manage them less and less, allowing you to turn your focus toward leadership and strategy. 
One more tip, think of yourself as a habit-changer. Seriously, current developments in neuroscience have revealed new and exciting information about how humans form habits. Habits shape everything we do, from our professional to our personal lives. Every day we engage in habit loops, that have been well-built over time, and in many cases are quite grooved, both behaviorally and neurologically. Think about your own day. Habit is behind your commute to the office, how you behave in meetings, and even how you answer your phone. When we do behaviors over and over again, they become grooved, and even develop thicker neurological pathways. In fact, research has shown that it takes about 40 repetitions of a behavior before it becomes grooved as a habit, and 66 shows measurably thickening of the pathways. 
What does this have to do with management? Well, first, as a manager, you have your own habits. Your default management style is one of them. It's well-grooved. If you want to help yourself become better at the other styles, you have to practice them, so they become habits too. In addition, managing people is largely about helping them form new habits, or better ones. As you give them task direction, or opportunities to make decisions, you're helping them develop new habits for working. Effective managers are patient and allow people time to learn and grow. Knowing that after about 40 repetitions of any new behavior, habits get formed. So play with the six styles, using them based on what's the best fit for the situation. You may even use one style with one employee, and a different style with another. Ultimately, your goal is to bring out the best in your people, and the right choice of management style is how you accomplish this. 

## 1.5 Going from peer to manager
So you’ve been promoted to manager. Congratulations, this is a great opportunity, and if you’re like most people you’re simultaneously excited and nervous, I know I was. We’ve all experienced bad bosses, and I’m sure you want to do a good job and be someone your employees trust and respect. In fact, that should be your goal. To build a relationship with them based on trust and respect.  
In this chapter we’ll cover ways you can do that, but first let’s talk about how you transition from being a peer to a manager.  
If you’re coming in from the outside and haven’t worked alongside your reports it can be easier, because you don’t have a previous relationship with them. You come into a role of authority. While they don’t know you, they also don’t have any preconceived notions about you. However, you’ll have more work to do to help them get to know you and trust you.  
If you’ve been promoted to supervise your colleagues, they do know you, which means they have some beliefs about who you are and how you’ll manage. These may or may not be accurate, so you may need to overcome not only their assumptions but your own.  
Whether you’re promoted from within or hired from the outside the following strategy should guide your actions the first few weeks and months.  

 - **First, have patience with their nervousness.** You probably remember having a new boss yourself, because we’ve all lived with poor managers people are somewhat anxious to see what kind of manager you’re going to be. This means that they’ll simultaneously be putting on their best behavior for you, and also guarded about what they share with you. They’ll also be trying to bend your ear about their priorities and concerns. That’s good, you want to learn all you can so listen. Just don’t promise anything early on until you’ve really had time to assess everything.  
 - This is a great time to focus on getting to **know your people, your second strategy.** One of the best things any new manager can do is to make a point of meeting with each of your people to learn more about them. Here are some key questions to ask: 
   - Tell me about your role 
   - I’d like to hear your perspective on what your priorities are and the challenges that you face. 
   - How I can support you in being successful? 
   - How do you like to be supervised? 
   - What motivates and engages you at work? 
 - At this point, don’t make any promises about what you will or won’t do. It’s too early to commit to anything.  
 - Also, it’s a good idea to meet with your colleagues in other departments, and also those above you. Ask them the first two questions, you’ll learn a lot. This is all part of the **third strategy, which is to take time and gather information.** This is certainly important if you’re new to the organization, but it’s even more so if you’re already working there and here’s why. As you move up you gain a whole new perspective about things. You’ll be privy to all kinds of information that you didn’t have before. You’ll learn more about the people above you, the organization’s goals and challenges, as well as confidential information about the budget and personnel files. Trust me when you move up, it’s a whole new world. So you want to take time to learn all that you can before you make any big decisions, or implement new ideas. While you may be brimming with them, it’s in your best interest to slow down, and thoroughly explore the real lay of the land.  
 - **Fourth, be transparent with your values and philosophy.** While you may be waiting to design and implement changes, you can use this time to share your values and management philosophy. This is how you start building trust and establishing your integrity. Your employers are nervous, and they want and need to know who you’re going to be.  
 - **Fifth, take time to craft your overall strategy.** Once you’ve gathered information you want to think about how you can address and resolve some of the challenges while also maximizing strengths and opportunities. This all needs to work within the structures and resources you have. By crafting your overall plan it will help you map out how you’ll make changes over time. In addition, it will be the North Star that will guide your decision making in all kinds of situations.  
 - **Finally, pace yourself.** I know you may be chomping at the bit to get started, but if you rush too quickly you may accidentally damage the relationships you’re trying to build. Your effectiveness as a manager is completely dependent on your ability to build positive working relationships with people all over your organization. So, focus on that first, and the rest will follow.  


## 1.6 Establishing trust
Establishing trust is an ongoing practice, something you do every day in your words and actions. As a manager, your success is dependent on creating an environment where you're seen as trustworthy, not only by your directory ports but also your supervisors and your peers. So how do you build trust? Let's look at the key practices. 

 - **First, have integrity with your words and actions.** This means that you do what you said you would. You follow through, meet deadlines, and keep your promises. This is not occasionally, but all the time. In the rare instances where you cannot deliver, you take responsibility, explain why, and even apologize when appropriate. 
 - **Second, share your values.** People have to know what you stand for in order to assess if you have integrity or not. Study after study shows that people assess trustworthiness based on how well you live in alignment with your values. They can do this faster if they know what your values are. Interestingly, they don’t have to like or approve your values for you to establish trust. 
 - **Third, make ethical choices. Ethics are another important aspect of integrity.** How they differ is that each culture or society has its own laws and norms that determine what's considered ethical within that context. Acting ethically is about being in alignment with the agreed-upon standards of that community. Certainly, the workplace has some agreed-upon standards, like not discriminating against people. Sometimes, an industry has a code of ethics like medicine's Hippocratic Oath of do no harm, and many organizations have their code of ethics that they outline in shared values or specific policies and practices. 
 - **Fourth, sincerely listen to others.** When you listen to others without judgment, it makes it easier for them to open up in the future. You want to be a place where people can bring their honest concerns, needs, priorities, and hopes and know that you'll listen. This doesn't mean that you have to give them everything they want. In fact, you often won't be able to. But if you listen and respond with respect, you'll build trust with every conversation. 
 - **Fifth, be accountable for your actions.** Part of managing is taking risks and making decisions. Sometimes you'll be successful, and sometimes you won't. If you blame others or make excuses, you'll damage trust. And if you take credit for other people's work, you harm trust too. So be accountable for your actions, both good and bad. Admit your mistakes and be proud of your wins. 
 - **Sixth, be honest in your communication.** Your word has to mean something. This is not only following through on promises, but also that you can be honest about anything. Sometimes honesty is hard. It means that you offer realistic assessments, frank critiques, and clear opinions. That can be challenging if you know the other person won't like what you have to say or may be hurt by it. But trust is also built on people knowing that you'll be honest. Find ways to communicate honestly and clearly, but also with kindness and empathy. It will make it easier to hear what you have to say. 
 - **Seventh, respond to feedback.** You'll be the recipient of feedback, and how you handle it is part of building trust. If you get defensive or shoot the messenger, you're gonna harm trust. As a manager, 
you have power in the relationship. So, you need to intentionally seek feedback and then make changes. Remember, people leave a boss, not a company. Before they leave, they'll try once or twice to give you feedback. If you don’t change, they'll start disengaging as they get ready to leave. So, take feedback very seriously. In fact, intentionally seek it out. Don’t just wait for people to bring you feedback or complaints. Actively seek out their opinions, both good and bad, about how things are going and reward honesty. When someone has the courage to tell you challenging news, sincerely thank them. They've shown you a great sign of respect. This is all part of making it safe to take risks. 

The last and most important practice, one of the worst things that can happen in work setting is if there's a culture of fear. When people are afraid, they're obviously not in trust. And even worse, you've shut down the pathway to creativity and innovation, something that all organizations need to be successful. As a manager, you need to create a culture where it's safe to take risks. Be open to hearing feedback or ideas that are different from yours. Also, don’t allow your employees to treat each other poorly. And don’t tolerate behavior that undermines safety for anyone in the organization. Be clear about how performance issues are handled. People feel safer if they trust that the process will be fair.  

If you consistently focus on building trust, you'll be able to do so. But the work doesn't stop there. While it takes time to build trust, it can be destroyed overnight. One violation on your part, can undo months of hard work. So make establishing trust one of your top and ongoing priorities. It should be built on a set of these practices that you use every day.  


# 2. Leading Productive Online Meetings

## 2.1 Having productive meetings 

Let's talk about meetings. It's important to remember that meetings are still part of the bigger picture of how you manage people, projects, and performance. They should align with your philosophy and style of management. Consider meetings as the time and place where you motivate and engage people with opportunities for autonomy, mastery and purpose. 
Let's get into some specific considerations and strategies for leading productive meetings.  
I call these the Four P's of great meetings.  
 - **First, get clear about the Purpose.** It's important to know what you hope to achieve. By getting clear on the outcome, you'll avoid scheduling unnecessary meetings. Meetings take a lot of forms, from one-on-one discussions to team project meetings, to presentations for large groups of people. The form should always support the purpose. Consider these questions to help you get clear about the purpose. 
   - Is this session interactive, or involve one-way communication? 
   - Is the goal to disseminate information to a group of people, or have people share information with each other? 
   - Do you need to work together to identify the source of a problem and brainstorm solutions? 
   - Will you be engaging in decision-making, and do you need to gain commitment for a course of action? 
 - **Second, choose the People.** Obviously invite the people that need to be there to accomplish the purpose. **Not everyone needs to be in every meeting, so be thoughtful about who you invite.** In order to prepare, you'll want to think about these issues.  
   - Will the participants know each other? 
   - What are their personalities? 
   - Are they likely to be competitive or collaborative? 
   - What will distract them? 
   - And what will they need to know in order to fully participate? 
 - **Third, Prepare for the meeting.** As the person who called the meeting, you're responsible for getting everything ready. This includes several pieces. 
   - Pick the best day, time and place that's most conducive to accomplishing your goal. 
   - Next, create an agenda. It allows you to outline what the meeting will cover, and how information will flow. It's best to use action verbs, like approve and decide. If people will be leading or speaking at various parts of the agenda, indicate their names, and if you're worried about staying on time, you can even indicate how many minutes are allotted. 
   - If your meeting is part of an ongoing series, build in a small portion of time to discuss past items and future items, but leave most of the time for the current issues at hand. 
   - Also, it's a good idea to think about the workload of the meeting. Open the meeting with something light, to get everyone settled and warmed up. Then get into the heavy-lifting of the meeting, where you accomplish the bigger tasks, and end with a wrap-up. 
   - Distribute your agenda to people in advance, allowing ample time if they need to prepare something. 
 - The **fourth P is designing a Process for facilitating the meeting.** It should align with the outcome you hope to achieve, and the needs of the participants you've invited. For some of you, your meetings will be governed by Robert's Rules of Order, a formal system often used in government or board meetings. But if not, here's some general guidelines to consider. 
   - Start and end on time. This shows that you respect the participants. 
   - Begin the meeting by reviewing the agenda and doing introductions if people don't know each other. 
   - Use some tools to keep the discussion on track. 
     - One option is called the bounce-back. If people go off-topic, acknowledge it and say, "That's a great topic for us to address at another time, "but let's refocus on the current discussion."
     - Some people like to use the parking lot, where you place topics and suggestions that you want to visit later. 
     - You may also use the talking clock, where you say things like, "Lisa will give her report in the next three minutes," or, "We have two minutes left "to discuss this agenda item." 
     - If you have decisions to make, consider how you'll vote on them. Will you use majority wins, weighted scoring? And will votes be public or private? The most important part of your role is to foster constructive group participation. 
   - Consider how you can get people engaged in the process. Ask open-ended questions. 
   - Throughout the meeting, summarize main points and identify action steps of who will do what, and by when. 
   - Conclude the meeting by having a closing round for comments and follow up by sending out notes or minutes directly to members or posting online in an appropriate place. 

*Meetings are a necessary part of the work world, but by using the Four P's, Purpose, People, Preparation and Process, you can create meetings that are both productive and engaging.*

## 2.2 Some suggestions for common challenges in meetings

### Someone is trying to hijack the meeting
 - Have a plan & provide a plan.
 - Move his/her points to the “Parking lot”.
 - Ask specific questions that make it more difficult for the meeting bully to take control.
 - Call it out - Acknowledge the comment and suggest the group review the purpose and agenda to determine if and where the hijacker’s issue fits into the agenda.
 - Master the art of transitions – wrap up what you heard and build a connection with your point.
 - Call on other participants by name to contribute and don’t let the meeting hijacker respond or interrupt.
 - Focus discussion on outcomes, rather than endless debates on specific points.
 - Establish and enforce rules of participation, particularly if it’s a regular meeting.

### Someone argues every point
 - Move this discussion to the “Parking lot”.
 - Refer to the group – “Guys, do you think it’s important to discuss it more deeply or can we leave it at this stage and move to the next point?”
 - Establish and enforce rules of participation, particularly if it is a regular meeting.

### Someone who wants to share too many ideas
 - Acknowledge it and ask to create a list of ideas that you will review afterwards. 
 - Acknowledge and mention that you are interested in others’ point as well.

### Silence
 - Ask direct questions.
 - Prepare spreadsheet with names.
 - Warn participants that you’d like to hear opinions of all of them.
 - Make some joke – for example “I hope you didn’t fall asleep after my monologue?”
 - “The faster you reply, the faster we’ll finish this meeting 😊”.

### Latecomers
 - “Tom, you are 15 minutes late and, as we are finishing on time, it will not possible for me to recap because to do that would mean that everyone would have to spend an extra 15 minutes.  Let me share with you a recording afterwards / MFU”.
 - Don’t start on the hour. 9:15 or 9.45 is perfectly good time as 9:00 or 9:30.
 - https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141113133137-223610295-9-ways-to-manage-meeting-latecomers/ 

### Interrupters / Know-it-alls 
 - “[name], could we just listen to XXX for a moment? Then we’ll listen to your point.”
 - “I appreciate your knowledge / ideas on this point – does anyone else have any relevant experience to share on this issue?” 
 - “[name], I know you are an expert here, so can we see where everyone else is on this topic before coming back to you?”
 - “[name] that’s really very interesting. However I really need to hear from XXX.”
 - “Ok, [name] you have 30 seconds to finish your point, because we have a lot to cover during this meeting.”
 - “We have already spent more time on this topic than agreed and we need to progress to the next point, otherwise we will run out of time.”

### Unprepared participants  
 - **Preventive steps:**  
   - Send them a clearly written statement about the meeting’s purpose, scope, and deliverable
   - Detailed questions determined agenda topics
   - Ideally participants should know the questions to be asked during the meeting before it begins
 - **Action steps:**  
   - `Situation:` despite the information you provided prior, participants are still unprepared
   - Try to find out the reason why people are not engaged
   - Regularly ask for input and invite questions
   - Make your meeting lively and interactive

### Team is unable to make decisions
`Situation:` Team members struggle to reach consensus and make decisions  
The responsibility for coming to decisions lies with the leader. :)   

 - Clarify the goal of the meeting, create expectations with agenda (see example above)
 - When people seem totally blocked, go back to the initial question or purpose, and rephrase it
 - Encourage members to vote and rank
 - Brainstorm (Don’t forget that someone should be in charge of leading to make sure everyone stays focused. Otherwise chaos will come.)

# 3 Managing Your Time and Stress

## 3.1 Delegating responsibilities 
To be successful as a manager, you must learn the art of delegating. It really is an art because when done right, it requires some thoughtful analysis and intentional choices on your part. 
Delegation is a very important interaction that lies at the intersection of three things.  
- The delegator, you. 
- The delegate, the person you're handing a task to and 
- the organization that the interaction is housed within. 

Delegation is the process of asking another person to do a task, while still maintaining responsibility for that task. It can range from giving someone a simple everyday task to appointing someone as the leader of a complex project.  
Appointments can be short-term, from minutes to a couple of weeks or long term, from a few weeks to months. But delegation is not just about handing off tasks. It's actually a great opportunity to further motivate and engage your employees by creating opportunities for their professional development.  
As the manager, you're in the role of the delegator and you're instrumental in making the process go smoothly. Most people think that there's only one phase. You ask the employee to do a task and they do it. Actually, successful delegation is more complex than that and requires you to be savvy with both project management as well as people skills.  
There is a **four-phase model of delegation.** The four phases are the **evaluation, handover, support, and debrief.** The phases are linear. Meaning that you need to complete one before you go on to the next.  

**The first phase is called evaluation.** In this phase, you assess aspects of the organization, your workload, and your employees. This will help you determine what can and should be delegated, and to whom various projects should be given. The goal here is to match up your employee's strength and opportunities for growth with the project that will help them further develop. Unfortunately, evaluation is the phase that most managers skip because they feel pressed for time. This can set up a pattern where managers try to do too many things themselves and then when the workload gets to be too much, dump tasks on others at the last minute. This not only affects the success of the tasks being done well but it can also harm the relationship between the manager and employees. So take the time to do this phase because it will you set you and your team up for success.  

**The second phase is called the handover.** In this phase, the focus is to communicate clear expectations about the goals of the tasks, resources that will be provided, and the timeline. You also determine how much autonomy you're going to give them. A crucial part of this phase is determining and communicating how much freedom you're assigning. Eight levels of autonomy cover who gathers the information, who makes the decision and who takes the action. By far and away, the biggest source of problems in delegation is lack of clarity about which level of autonomy is being given.  

Eight levels of Autonomy while delegating:  
 - **Level 1:** The delegate has no autonomy. Delegate looks into the problem, gathers the information, and gives it to the manager who makes the decision. The manager also takes the action.
 - **Level 2:** Delegate explores the alternatives available, noting the pros and cons of each option. The delegate presents this analysis to the manager, who decides what to do and takes the action.
 - **Level 3:** Delegate explores the options and makes a decision, recommending a course of action to the manager. The manager approves the decision and takes the action.
 - **Level 4:** Delegate explores the options and makes the decision about a course of action, but delays implementation until the manager approves it. At that point the delegate takes the action.
 - **Level 5:** Delegate informs the manager of his or her plans and can take action unless the manager says not to (The manager is holding veto power).
 - **Level 6:** Delegate takes action and informs the manager after the fact what was done and how it turned out.
 - **Level 7:** Delegate takes action and only communicates with the manager if the action was not successful.
 - **Level 8:** The delegate has complete autonomy in this highest level. Delegate takes action and does not need to communicate anything to the manager.

**The third phase is called support.** In this phase, you deliver any resources or support promised in phase two. This includes granting access to authority, providing resources, and coaching your employee as needed. Delivering what you promised builds trust and respect with your employees. Again, contributes to the successful completion of the task. During the support phase, you also monitor the progress of the employee and the ways you agreed upon during the handover.  

**The final phase in the delegation process is called the debrief.** This phase occurs once the task is completed. Thus, ending the delegation. You and the employee meet to discuss the outcome of the task as well as the process of delegation. You discuss things like what issues arose, lessons learned and ideas for improving for the future.  

As you delegate more proficiently, your team will become more effective and efficient in completing tasks. You also gain the benefit of moving some things off your plate which frees you up to focus time and energy on the projects that require your knowledge and experience. 

## 3.2 Avoiding micromanagement 
Micromanagement is what happens when delegation goes badly, and it's usually due to one of **three causes.**  

**The first cause is an incomplete evaluation.** The evaluation phase is the phase that most people skip because they're often delegating under pressure. They're in a hurry to offload something during a stressful time, and that never ends well.  

**The second cause is lack of clarity about the level of autonomy.** When an employee feels micromanaged, it's because they thought they were getting a higher level of autonomy than they are. It's the manager's responsibility to make the level clear. When you communicate the level you're giving to the delegate, you eliminate any confusion or mistaken assumptions that either of you may of had. Over time, as employees are successful, you should be granting higher levels of autonomy. This demonstrates that you trust your employees, which will contribute to their motivation and engagement.  

**The third cause of micromanagement is the manager violating the agreed upon level of autonomy.** When it's unnecessary, it will feel like micromanagement to the delegate. In other words, the delegate could complete the task successfully, but the manager stepped in. This not only frustrates the delegate but short-changes their opportunity to learn and grow. Sometimes it's not even conscious. The manager truly believes that they're just helping and doesn't see the bigger ramifications of what's happening. Most often, when managers violate the agreed upon level of autonomy, it's related to the manager's discomfort with letting go. While the manager may have had good intentions to honor the level of autonomy, they're not able to control their personal reaction to the letting go process.  

**Concerns you face and its solution**  

**First:** Thinking that it's easier or faster do it yourself. This one is tricky because it usually is easier or faster to do it yourself. You may be tempted to take over the task and just get it done, but remember, a large part of being a good manager is about developing your people. You need to give them the opportunity to learn, which takes time.  

**The second cause is worrying that your staff are already overburdened and cannot take on anything more.** I've struggled with this myself, but it has helped to remember that employees are most satisfied and motivated when they get opportunities to grow. Talk with them and brainstorm together about how to shift things around, or even eliminate unnecessary tasks to make room for new opportunities.  

**The third reason people struggle with micromanagement is fear of losing control or importance.** Delegation involves the loss of direct control and this may cause some managers great discomfort. This is the great thing about delegation. It pushes everyone to grow a little, even you. Remember, you can build in progress checks and coaching discussions to create a safety net that allows you to keep an eye on things. This also allows your employees space to develop new skills. I also find it helpful to remember that there are many paths to an outcome. If you know your employee can produce the work, be more flexible with how they get there.  

So try these strategies to help you overcome the temptation of micromanagement. If you find that you continue to struggle with letting go, don't hesitate to seek the support of a career coach or a personal counselor. Part of how you're assessed as a manager is how your team grows and develops, so it's an investment in your career, as well. Remember that the growth of your team depends on your ability to let them try.  

## 3.3 Managing your time 
Being a manager means you manage a lot of things. We've already covered all the ways you'll manage people and their performance. Now we're going to look at how you manage the business. This includes making decisions, overseeing projects, complying with key policies and regulations, and managing the budget. 
The first place we need to start is how you manage your time. Being a manager is really a juggling act. You must keep a lot of balls in the air at the same time. Your first priority is having a method for managing your time, so that you can attend to each of the important things you oversee, without exhausting yourself or burning out. 
I'd like to add the following tips.  

**First, really focus on what is true about you.** Managing your time starts with you and how you, and only you, interact with time. This includes when you're at your best for certain types of tasks. For example, my mind is sharpest in the morning from eight to noon. That is the best time for me to do activities that require a lot of thinking, like writing or designing training sessions.  
Another thing to consider is how long you can focus without a break, and how long of a break you need before you're fresh again. There are no right answers, but there are the answers that are true for you. 

**Second, explore the different components of time management.** People often think that time management is just about clocks and calendars, but it's really about managing all the things that take your time. This means that you need to look at managing your email, scheduling your calendar, and even files, papers and notes.  

**Third, creating a system that supports how you really work.** Once you know more about yourself, choose or design a system that supports you. The only criteria is that it helps you be more focused and effective.  

**Finally, and perhaps the most importantly, learn how to say no, or at least not now.** A big part of managing your time includes protecting it. All the wonderful intentions and systems will go out the door if you continue to pile things on your already full plate.   
*A good lesson:*  
So one of your key strategies is to control the flow of things that you take on. This can be especially challenging if you have a hard time disappointing people. `It's called the disease to please`, and I suffered from it for years. I kept taking on more and more, getting more stressed out with each commitment. And then I started getting angry and resentful at my job. One day I was being asked, once again, to take on something. I was already super stressed out working evenings and weekends, and still not getting everything done. I said to my boss, "I don't understand how you expect me "to take on this project. "Can't you see how overwhelmed I am?" And she said, "Brit, I'm not putting this project on you. "I came to you and asked if you could take it on. "Your answer could be yes or no. "If you can't do it that's fine, "just tell me and I'll ask someone else." Wow, I was stunned. No was an option? When I thought back on it, I realized that was how I ended up with every project on my overflowing plate. She'd asked, and I had said yes. Needless to say that was a big life lesson. It really showed me how I was not taking responsibility for my own time or priorities. And the ability to say no is part of that.  

I actually recommend you have go-to phrases that you practice and use. Here are a couple of mine. This buys you time to think. 
 - "Let me get back to you in 48 hours. 
 - "I need to assess what's currently on my plate." 
 - "Let's chat about what task we'll take off my plate "to make room for this one." 
And perhaps the most powerful, "No thank you."  

I encourage you to create your own list and practice them out loud until you get more comfortable saying them. That way you'll be ready when someone is standing in front of you with a request. Together, all of these strategies will help you be at your best so you can manage others with style and grace.

## 3.4 Verbal akido technique

In this technique, First "You agree with a statement and its importance" and then "continue with your own opinion on the matter"

| 1. I agree                                | 2. Continue with your Opinion                     |
| -------------                             |:-------------:                                    |
| "Yes, I agree with the fact that..."      | "Thats why lets discuss some risks we can have.." |
| "Yes, Its really important to..."         | "Besides, we had some issues previously.." |
| "Yes, this matter is important for us..." | "And thats why lets look at pluses and minuses" |

## 3.5 Saying No

 - Listen what the person is trying to say
 - Give reason (for No)
 - Summarize and provide final statement
 - Offer alternative solutions

# 4. Helping your team develop


# 5. Managing Team Performance Remotely

## 5.1 Managing remote employees 

With today's technology, it's likely that you have employees working remotely. Nearly 2/3 of US companies give employees workplace flexibility. This can range from the colleague who works from home a few days per year to the employee who permanently lives and works in another geographic location. You may even lead virtual teams with members spread around the globe. 
A lot of wonderful tools make this all possible.  
File sharing and cloud-based tools make it easy for people to work on projects and documents together without being together.  
E-mail, instant messaging, and video calls have turned our phones and computers into high-powered communication devices that can cross continents and time zones.  
While all of this leads to enhanced productivity, it can also lead to some challenges for today's manager. Let's explore some methods you can use for maximizing the benefits while mitigating the risks.  
Set people up for success with the right technology. Remote employees can only be successful if the technology works. You need to outfit your people with the right tools, including internet access, computers or laptops, and software. Make sure that they have what they need and develop a schedule for keeping everything up to date. Measure work by deliverables rather than activities. Since it will be harder for you to observe people working, you need to shift your focus to the results of their efforts. Focus on outcomes or products. This shift should be addressed in your performance management process in terms of how goals are set and how and when you measure success. Focus on communication and inclusion.  
One of the pitfalls of remote employees is they can miss a lot of the spontaneous communication that occurs when people gather near the copier or coffee machine. Encourage both the local and remote employees to use tools like instant messaging and video calls to include people in the informal exchanges that occur every day. Also, consider how you can include your remote employees in the culture of the organization. Whenever you have something for the local employees, see how you can create a mirror for your remote people. You can certainly include them in onsite trainings and events by making remote viewing possible. But what about the birthday celebration for a colleague? Consider bringing a laptop so they can attend via video. Or what about the family day at the local zoo? Send them tickets to the zoo in their town. Help them create a healthy work-life balance.  
Research has shown that remote employees tend to put in more hours than their local peers. This is both good and bad news. It means that you don't have to worry about them goofing off, but you do need to worry that they'll overwork, which can lead to burnout. Discuss how they'll monitor their work time, so they don't overdo it. And also have them create a dedicated workspace so they keep work separate from their home life. Our home should be where we go and relax at the end of the workday, not a place that reminds us of work.  
Let's turn our attention to virtual teams where you have several employees working together from different locations. This is also known as dispersion, and there are actually different types of dispersion. Each type requires different kinds of guidance or support, and some teams are combinations of several types.  
First, you have people that are geographically dispersed. This can be as close as different buildings on a campus to offices scattered around the world. The amount of distance matters, as farther distances make it impossible to just pop by for a face to face discussion.  
Second, you have temporally separated teams, meaning that people are in different time zones. This often means that work cannot occur synchronously but is always offset by several hours. This can create challenges, because all communication is mediated through written words like e-mail, losing valuable non-verbal cues.  
Another level of dispersion is any quality in the configuration. For example, if you have four people in one location working with two people in another. This can start to create a click, if you will, of the people who work near each other, because they share experiences, communication, and even culture. And of course, you have cultural diversity. People from different regions, countries, cultures, and languages may not produce or perceive work in the same ways. The behaviors that indicate trust and respect in one culture can be offensive in another. Add to this the additional barriers of language and then communication mediated through e-mail, and you have a situation that's ripe for misunderstandings and conflict.  
The solution to all these challenges is communication and training. As a manager, you need to provide tools for communication and even set standards for how and when it should be done. Dispersed teams benefit from training on how to work in a dispersed environment. This should include an opportunity for members to get to know each other and build trust. This goes a long way to mediating conflict when it does arise. Also, consider appointing someone as the facilitator of the group process. This is separate from the task they're accomplishing together. This person would keep an eye on the issues we've discussed, helping the group successfully navigate the challenges.  
As a manager, be open to learning from your experiences with remote employees and dispersed teams. This will help you adjust over time that will improve the experience for everyone involved. 

# 6. Value of Motivation  

## 6.1 How to access that all are motivated within team

 - How often does a person takes up a task voluntarily, how much time is needed for him to complete and how is the quality of the solution
 - Is the person always Late for meetings?
 - How often does the person come up with the new ideas, joins in on optional meetings
 - Is he active on meetings? is he able to verbalize his/her interests, needs?
 - If in online meetings, are they sharing cameras?
 - Are they willing to join team buildings, online coffe sessions?

## 6.2 What will you do to identify motivation gaps?
 - Listen, Observe, Check performance
 - Check body language
 - Hold one-on-one meetings regularly, analyze feedback on the person/team
 - Maintain relationship with RM to talk about the person, RM can give you advice on the aspirations of the person so you can plan the tasks accordingly

## 6.3 Monitor Motivation level and compensate if any issues?
 - **Monitor**: 
   - Performance in general
   - Performance on meetings
   - Collaboration with other team members
   - willingness to cooperate
   - proactive behavior
 - **Compensate**: 
   - Ask
   - Listen
   - Give Feedback
   - Try to customize the tasks
   - Delegate Well
   - Online Team buildings
   - Retros with discussing concerns
 - **Strategical thinking in Team dynamics**:  
   - Take care of the *opinion leaders* of the team with extra care because they will influence the team atmosphere
 - Show example, share vision and mission
 - Negative feedback in private, positive feedback in public
 - Milestone celebration
 - Bring in professionally interesting tasks
 - Get to know the motivation of individuals (build in thei feedback/suggestion)

**Gudelines for 1-on-1 meeting for motivating**
 - Understand reason for demotivation by asking the right questions
 - Understand what he does not like and give background info on that
 - Ask his ideas on how to change the situation
 - Find out what would make him better
 - Build rapport: Examples would be  
   - How was the flat renovation?
   - how covid affected you
   - What video games you have played recently
   - Places you visited recently
 - Discover the carrer aspirations of the person

 
# 7 Effective Conflict Resolution

## 7.1. Resolving Conflict

**How do you feel about conflict?**  
It's interesting, but a lot of people think that conflict is a bad thing. Something to be avoided or deescalated as quickly as possible. But conflict is a natural byproduct of both group development and diversity. Much of conflict is healthy and contributes to the growth of the individual and the organization.  
As a manager, you'll find that dealing with conflict is a normal part of your responsibilities. **One model that's very helpful to know, is Tuckman's five stages of group development.** Tuckman did research on groups, and his findings have stood the test of time. This model is still taught in today's business schools.  

**The first stage is called forming.** This is the time when the members are introduced to the group, and they get acquainted.**The second stage is called storming,** because it's when conflict arises. The group is sorting out their differences as they try to organize their goals and ideas.  
**The third stage is called norming**, and this is when group cohesion gets established. Members find effective ways to share ideas and suggestions.  
**Performing is the fourth stage**, and the group achieves interdependence. Members are self-directed and productive. Groups can hang out in this fourth stage for quite a while, but eventually they** move into the last stage, adjourning.** This is when the project or group is wrapped up. Members finish up the task, organize reports and documents, and they celebrate their successes.  
As a manager, you need to expect conflict and be comfortable handling it. The goal is to **know the difference between healthy conflict and toxic conflict that can do harm**.  
You can identify toxic conflict by the following, people openly use insulting or demeaning words and actions, like name-calling, shaming and sneering, or people sabotage or undermine the efforts of another, usually behind their back. Both methods are destructive. They not only kill trust, but they also undermine the efforts and goals of the group and organization. You should have a zero-tolerance policy for these kinds of conflict behaviors. However, toxic conflict is rare, and only shows up when people cannot resolve their differences through more open and healthy means. To this end, you want to **create an environment where healthy conflict can be embraced**. Let's see how Adriana demonstrates the following strategies: 
 - **First, she designs regular opportunities where people can have open discussions about issues.** Adriana encourages debate by asking for alternative ideas and solutions. She makes the devil's advocate a regular member of her meetings by intentionally exploring the other side of issues and she makes it clear that it's okay to disagree with her. 
 - **Second, Adriana regularly role models how to have healthy debate, and what respectful disagreement looks like.** We don't see many examples of this in our society and you'd be surprised how effective a little modeling can be. 
 - **Third, when conflict does arise, Adriana gives it a little space and time to let her team handle it on their own.** You want to avoid stepping in too early. As long as you don't see anything toxic, you can afford to see what happens. 
 - **Fourth, when people come to Adriana, she supports them in working it out.** She empowers them to take responsibility for the situation. She has set the expectation that they need to first attempt to resolve the conflict. And if they come to her, they must share what steps they've already taken. If you need to step in, do so as a coach, using clarity and skill coaching to help the people involved move to resolution. Here's some great questions to ask: 
   - Can you identify what the source of conflict is for you? 
   - What are your needs, concerns and goals in this situation? 
   - Are there any hidden agendas, vested interests or emotional attachments at play? 
   - How would you summarize the other person's perspective? 
   - Where are your places of agreement? 
   - And can you build on those?
 And identify some possible solutions that would close the gap between your differences. Remember, the goal is not to prevent conflict, but embrace it to help your group grow and thrive.

## 8.5 What is a problem and steps in solving it
**Problem**  
 - Something that requires a solution, decision or responses
 - Absense or lack of something, difference between the current and ideal situations
 - Typically results in unwanted outcome if not effectively addressed
 - Has an significant impact
 - May require a team or collective effort
**Steps of Critical thinking process**  
 - 1. Identify and Define the problem
 - 2. Gather and study information
 - 3. Consider solutions and alternatives
 - 4. Choose and implement Solution
 - 5. Evaluate

> How youframe the problem will impact how you proceed to solve or analyze it


### 8.5.1. Identify and Define the problem

 - Best done in dialogue
 - Investigative process
 - Precise problem statement needed

**Define the problem:**
 - Can you elaborate more on this?
 - What do you mean by that?

 - What caused this to happen
 - What does it have in common with other issues? how is it different?
 - Can you give an example?
 - What are the exceptions?
 - What are other perspectives? What other actors think about it?
 - Why are we having this problem? What caused it?
 - What exactly are we trying to solve here?

### 8.5.2. Gather and study information
 - Define the Context
 - What are the facts and circumstances for this problem?
 - Recognize assumptions

|-----:| ----------|:-------------:                                                                                                                                                    |
|  1   | 5 whys    | An analytical technique where you ask “Why?” five times to understand why something is happening. This approach can lead you to the issue’s root cause|
|  2   | 7 so whats| An analytical technique where you ask “So what?” seven times to understand the future implications of any actions you might take. This helps you identify possible new problems or opportunities that will arise from your actions|
|  3   | 80/20 rule| Also known as the Pareto principle, this rule suggests that 80% of the effects of an issue come from 20% of the issue’s causes.|
|  4   | root cause| The earliest underlying factor contributing to a problem|

> 1. Paretos's Principle: 80% of results come from 20% of tasks
> 2. Parkinson's Law: time to completion compresses with time allocated.

> **Output of using both:** Prioritize high impact tasks. Give yourself ultra-strict deadlines to force focus and flow
