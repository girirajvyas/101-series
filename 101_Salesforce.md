   App: An app in Salesforce is a set of objects, fields, and other functionality that supports a business process. You can see which app you’re using and switch between apps using the App Launcher (App Launcher icon).
   Objects: Objects are tables in the Salesforce database that store a particular kind of information. There are standard objects like Accounts and Contacts and custom objects like the Property object you see in the graphic.
   Records: Records are rows in object database tables. Records are the actual data associated with an object. Here, the 211 Charles Street property is a record.
   Fields: Fields are columns in object database tables. Both standard and custom objects have fields. On our Property object, we have fields like Address and Price.

   
   Object Manager: Object Manager is where you can view and customize standard and custom objects in your org.
   Setup Menu: The menu gives you quick links to a collection of pages that let you do everything from managing your users to modifying security settings.
   Main Window: We’re showing you the Setup home page, but this is where you can see whatever it is you’re trying to work on.
