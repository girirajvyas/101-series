## History

David Kelley and Tim brown of IDEO and Stanford university COined the term in the early 1990s. It started as a project within IDEO and quickly moved from academic to being a practical solution for businesses.  
Some of the brands that embrace design thinking are Google, IBM, GE, etc

## Why design thinking
 "Design thinking is extremely useful in tackling problems that are ill defined or unknown, bt reframing the problem in human-centric ways, creating many ideas in brainstorming sessions and adopting A HANDS-ON approach in prototyping and testing"


Definition: Design thinking is a problem solving methodology used by designers, such as engineers, to solve complex problems and generate creative solution

 - desirability - human (it all starts from here i.e desirability)
 - viability - business
 - Feasibility - Technical
 - intersection of all -> innovation
 - model of rww (real win worthit)

## What is Design Thinking?
 - It means making things look good and function efficiently 
 - It is about creating things that people need
 - It focuses on the way that users react to designers creation
 - It is different from engineering
 - Engineering is applied when we know waht we want to design
 - Instead of technological efficiency and mechanical improvements, design tinking forcuses on how users benefit personally from the designers output
 - It can be used earlier in the process, even before we know what we want to design
 - It is a set of frameworks and tools that leads us through the process of creation to make our creations more successful
 - It is a stepwise process for designing original solutions for people's problems and challenges
 - It is a **Human centred approach**
 - Goal is to design solutions that make peoples lives better by reducing the things they dislike and increasing the things what they like

## Design Thinking principles
Design thinking is about principles:  
 - The First principle is about diversity, where different perspectives add to innovation and helps avoid unconscious bias.  
 - The Second Principle is about unmet needs to uncover the needs people didn't even know they had
 - The Third and Fourth principles are about action. Its action of constantly tweaking and sense checking along the way, while building it cheaply and quickly.  
 - The last principle talks about iterations. Its the feedback that allows for constant and relevant improvements to any problem.  

 - **Diversity:** Invite diverse perspectives to the table
 - **Unmet needs:** explore unmet needs to discover new opportunities
 - **build:** build to learn quickly and cheaply
 - **actions:** get from insight to action
 - **iterations:** create change through iterations
 - **application:** can be used to solve any problem

## What is Design Thinking Mindset?
 - Driven by curiosity
 - Focus on people
 - Accept complexity
 - Visualize and show
 - Experiment and iterate (fail fast approach)

(Dont jump to conclusion directly)

## Design thinking process
 - 1. Empathize
 - 2. Define
 - 3. Ideate
 - 4. prototype
 - 5. Test
 - Again empathize or go to any stage that you believe you missed (i.e iterate)

## 1. Empathy
 Understanding users by what they:
    - Think
    - Feel
    - Do

"Unlike traditional marketing research, empathic research is not concerned with facts about people (such as their weight or the amount of food they eat), but more about their motivations and thoughts (for instance, why they prefer to sit at home watching TV as opposed to going out for a jog)."  
  --interation-design.org

### 1.1 Empathetic research Techniques:
 - **Observation:** This technique can be used to discover things that people cannot or will not tell you about their lives
 - **Skilled interviewing:** This technique is used to discover thoughts and feelings about specific issues, and to learn about processes that happen only internally within the mind of a person. For instance, how a user decides to buy a mobile mobile app. In this case, you should prepare a set of questions in writing in advance.
 - **Supervised shopping:** Asking a user to go, select and buy a product. When user is doing that observe and note down the action, thouughts, feeling of the user. Interviewer can ask questions to reveal user's feelings and thoughts.
 - **Projection:** Instead of asking directly, give them an activity, where they project their feelings onto an object, or ask them to discuss an issue that relates indirectly to their own feelings.  

**Note:** In any case, you must be careful about asking questions, interrupting interviewee or putting your words or thoughts into interviewee's mind. Let the interviewee speak 90% of the time.

## Design thinking phases
 - **A. Understanding phase:** Define the problem statement
   - 1. Business hypothesis
     - Form the vision
     - Identify key stakeholders
     - identify key business areas
   - 2. Customer perspective
     - Understand customer problems and challenges
     - Define goals and challenges 
     - Precision Q/A helps in getting the better results from this step
   - 3. Design challenge
     - Identify and prioritize most inportant goals
     - Generally a question for example
     - How might we provide access to the information so that users can access it quickly using different types of devices?
 - **B. Design phase:** Visualize the Solution
   - 1. Ideate
     - Identify
     - Prioritize
     - Select
   - 2. Prototype
     - Showcase the idea
     - Key features
   - 3. Test
     -
 - **C. Finally making impact**
   - Prerequisites
   - Dependencies
   - Impact
   - measure (quantify)

## Importance of understanding the problem: (Alber einstein)
If i had 60 minutes i will spend 55 mins understandi

## Ideation approach
go gave us 10 styluses lets not invent another  (Steve jobs)

## Ideation techniques
 - Brain storming
 - Brain dump
 - Brain writing
 - Brain walk
 - mind mapping
 - Reverse thinking
 - provocation (not realistic ideas)
 - Worst possible idea
 - Focus on What and not how
 - Divergent (generate as many ideas as possible) vs convergent (how all this generated ideas align more towards the case)
 - Challeng assumptions
 - Finally prototyping
 - or storyboard for customer journey
 - Game storming where creating a game to think through

## Prototyping
 - Prototyping is an experimental process where design teams implement ideas into tangible forms from paper to digital
 - 

## Prototyping Techniques
 - Sketeches and diagrams
 - paper interfaces
 -  storyboards
 - physical models
 - 

## Testing techniques
 - Show, dont tell
 - Compare alternatives
 - Observe
 - I like, I wish (what the user like and what they wish)

## Team formattion
Form a team of 4 people with different skill sets (prefferable to bring different perspectives)

## Reference problem
 - Reports are not available when needed
   - As a user, I can view any predefined reports
     - Predefined reports should be loaded within 2 secs (added NFRs)
 - Customer onboarding take a lot of time and erroneous
   - As an admin, I can onboard a new customer effectively
 - I am unable to find information when needed

# Day 2

## Stakeholders
**CTO:**  
**Responsible for:** Tech, Budget, Busi, Finance high level questions, arch related Qs, tech, data, security - governance

**Head of operations:**  
**Responsible for:** Timelines, delivery & Ops, Project Execution, 3rd party agreements,  

**Product Owner:**
**Responsible for:** requirements - functional & business understanding, what the product should be - features,

## Problem Statement (Case study)

> Case Study: Provide seamless access to multiple branded clothes websites to users so they can find right option effectively.

## Lets think all the questions to start with
**Find why?**
 - Is there any gap in market for aggreated portal? (research if their are)
 - What kind of challenges are we going to address?
 - Has there been a Market Survey?
 - What would be the benefit/profit/ROI from this business?
 - Who are the end user/ any specific section of user ?
 - How is the end user/consumer and producer related ?
 - Is it for local/International market ?
 - Are there any specific portals in consideration for starter?
 - How would be the design of the application
 - Time to Market

**Divide the problem**  
- Provide seamless access
  - seamless? website? mobile and desktop, android/ios app
- multiple branded clothes websites
   - Any specific sites
- to users so they can find right option effectively.
   - what is right option?

`Note:` Make sure you do not do this activity in notepad or on you local machine. you learned the tools like miro beforehand so that it can be used here

## Precision questions

You already have a bunch of questions now with you, how do you proceed now. You have to make sure you are utilizing the time that you get with the stakeholders. And to do this you must ask precise questions. Lets see if the below table helps you in doing the same

![Precision questions](https://github.com/girirajvyas/101-series/blob/master/resources/images/design_thinking/precision_questions.PNG)

## Interact with Stakeholders

Now, you have done a great job in identifying the precise questions. Lets have a connect with stakeholders to get their perspective

`Note:` Where are you taking notes and all the ideas? is it still notepad..!!! Switch to tool and learn using it now

## Business hypothesis and Customer perspective
- Business hypothesis (With stakeholders)
  - Form the vision: 
    - What impact we are trying to make (ROI, Benefits or NGO?)
    - what does a mvp(minimum viable product) / final product look like in your vision
  - Identify key stakeholders: 
    - Who are the End users?
    - Who is trying to build this?
    - Which portals(branded clothes websites) we are trying to connect?
  - Identify key business areas:
    - Which type of cloths?
    - Type of market demand we are planning to fill in (local/international)

- Customer perspective (End users)
  - Understand customer problems and challenges
    - 1. What is the current problem you are facing? (answer will be elaborative and we have to take points)
      - inshop experience online or home should be similar
    - 2. How does an ideal solution/approach looks like?
      - 5 things on site and added to cart, it should be delivered, tried first and then pay
         - explore lenskart option of trying onlin (enhanced feature, check feasibility)
         - pay on delivery options (Card/cash?)
         - personal shoppers to give recommendations
            - How this would be different from filter?
              - more filters will help? yes it may work
              - VR
     - 3. Multiple branded clothes websites? Any 10
       - Allen Solly, Van Huesen, Avirate, And, Vero Moda, H&M, Marks & Spencer, Levis,
     - 4. How do you access websites?
       - Android app always (not even browser)
     - 5. Do you provide feedbacks?
       - on extreme experience (good/bad)
     - 6. 
  - Define goals and challenges 
    - When do you expect this live/time to market?

## Desing a challeng that you want to work on
- Design challenge (Input for the next Ideate phase. Crisp and clear problem statement for next phase)
  - Identify and prioritize most important goals
   - How might we provide access to the different portals so that users can access it quickly using different types of devices?


# Day 3:

Lets start a new day with the challenge you have set in front of you
 
**Design challenge:**  
 - Provide access to end users that have acccess to atleast 5 portals that have a good filtering options like size, colour, etc and notification mechanism about the product purchased (purchased/delayed)

Summary of all the steps:  

## Empathize 
   - discuss with diferent user 
   - should have been covered in previous sessions

## Define
  - discuss with diferent stakeholders 
  - Define the problem (1 lines with mvp in line)

## Ideate
 - **It is mandatory that you complete above steps before you start this** 
 - What to build is first question
   - mobile app? 
    - SPA, ios/android, website?
 - options for integration
    - API
    - Files

### Solutioning:
  - Frontend
    - Micro-Frontends?
  - Backend
    - Architecture?
      - Microservies
  - Data
    - SQL for transactional data
    - Cassandra/elastic search for data to show
  - Other
    - Deployment
    - 

## prototype
   - Figma/miro

## Test
 - Ask users to test

## Repeat
 Again empathize or go to any stage that you believe you missed (i.e iterate)

## Focus points should be

 - Finish completely
 - NFRs
 - Tracebility matrix? -> show complete flow (technology, flow) -> (requirement to business journey) 
 - Phase 1 requirements should be in demo
 - Try to focus on (pain points)
 - Dont jump to tech soon

## Extra: 
book Design Thinking as Mindset, Process, and Toolbox

Design Thinking is a development that has recently attracted significant attention in the management discourse. The Institute of Information Management at the University of St.Gallen, the academic home of all three authors, has been conducting Design Thinking teaching and research for 10 years. In this study, Design Thinking is defined as: mindset, process, and toolbox. As a mindset, Design Thinking is characterized by several key principles: a combination of divergent and convergent thinking, a strong orientation to both obvious and hidden needs of customers and users, and prototyping. As a process, Design Thinking is seen as a combination of a micro- and a macro-process. The micro-process—as innovation process per se—consists of these steps: “Define the Problem”, “Needfinding and Synthesis”, “Ideate”, “Prototype” and “Test”. The macro-process consists of milestones manifested in prototypes that must fulfill defined requirements. As a toolbox, Design Thinking refers to the application of numerous methods and techniques from various disciplines: design, but also engineering, informatics, and psychology. Today, a growing number of companies, consulting firms, and universities use Design Thinking, continuously enlarging and re-defining its meaning. At University of St.Gallen, Design Thinking is taught as a problem-based course, together with research partner companies, with more than 40 projects successfully completed over the past 10 years. Research in Design Thinking at the University of St.Gallen focuses on aspects of modeling the Design Thinking processes and corporate entrepreneurship. In the near future, Design Thinking is expected to be deployed as an innovative method in corporations and also become an integral part of management education, particularly innovation. In addition, it will be developed further at the interface of design, design management and engineering sciences
